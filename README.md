# Java University Enrollment System 🎓

## 📚 About The Project
This comprehensive Java application serves as an educational demonstration of three fundamental programming paradigms, built around a real-world university registration scenario. Students can register for courses, calculate fees based on credit hours and majors, and interact with a user-friendly GUI interface.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Procedural Programming**: Implements Insertion Sort algorithm for organizing student data
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Features inheritance hierarchies (Student → ITStudent/EngineeringStudent), polymorphism, and encapsulation
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Interactive GUI with ActionListeners, MouseListeners, and KeyListeners for real-time user input
- **Fee Calculation**: Automatically calculates tuition based on:
  - Student's major (IT or Engineering)
  - Selected subjects and credit hours
  - Department-specific credit hour costs
