# Java University Enrollment System 🎓

## 📚 About The Project
This comprehensive Java application serves as an educational demonstration of three fundamental programming paradigms, built around a real-world university registration scenario. Students can register for courses, calculate fees based on credit hours and majors, and interact with a user-friendly GUI interface.

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Procedural Programming**: Implements Insertion Sort algorithm for organizing student data
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Features inheritance hierarchies (Student → ITStudent/EngineeringStudent), polymorphism, and encapsulation
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Interactive GUI with ActionListeners, MouseListeners, and KeyListeners for real-time user input
- **Fee Calculation**: Automatically calculates tuition based on:
  - Student's major (IT or Engineering)
  - Selected subjects and credit hours
  - Department-specific credit hour costs

## 💡 Educational Value
This project is ideal for:
- Understanding different programming paradigms
- Learning Java fundamentals
- Exploring GUI development with Swing
- Practicing clean code and documentation standards

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Eclipse
- **GUI Framework**: Swing
- **Paradigms**: Procedural, OOP, Event-Driven
- **Key Concepts**: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Exception Handling

## 🌟 Why This Project Stands Out
- Demonstrates mastery of multiple programming paradigms in one cohesive project
- Real-world applicability with university registration scenarios
- Clean, well-documented code following industry standards
- Progressive complexity from simple algorithms to complex GUI interactions
